## What is Surge?

Surge is designed for power users who prefer a keyboard-driven workflow. It features a beautiful **Terminal User Interface (TUI)**, as well as a background **Headless Server** and a **CLI tool** for automation.

## Why use Surge?

Most browsers open a single connection for a download. Surge opens multiple (up to 32), splits the file, and downloads chunks in parallel. But we take it a step further:

- **Blazing Fast:** Designed to maximize your bandwidth utilization and download files as quickly as possible.
- **Multiple Mirrors:** Download from multiple sources simultaneously. Surge distributes workers across all available mirrors and automatically handles failover.
- **Sequential Download:** Option to download files in strict order (Streaming Mode). Ideal for media files that you want to preview while downloading.
- **Daemon Architecture:** Surge runs a single background "engine." You can open 10 different terminal tabs and queue downloads; they all funnel into one efficient manager.
- **Beautiful TUI:** Built with Bubble Tea & Lipgloss, it looks good while it works.

For a deep dive into how we make downloads faster (like work stealing and slow worker handling), check out our **[Optimization Guide](docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md)**.

## Support the Project

We are just two CS students building Surge in between classes and exams. We love working on this, but maintaining a project of this scale takes time and resources. That's where you come in!

If Surge saves you time, consider supporting the development! Donations go directly toward:

- **Publishing the Extension:** Paying the Chrome Web Store fee so you can finally install the extension officially (no more sideloading!).
- **Dev Tools:** Licenses for tools like **GoReleaser Pro** to help us automate our builds.
- **Debrid Integration:** Covering subscription costs so we can test and build native Debrid support.

_Totally optional—your stars, issues, and contributions already mean the world to us! :)_

## Usage

Surge has two main modes: **TUI (Interactive)** and **Server (Headless)**.

For a full reference, see the **[Settings &amp; Configuration Guide](docs/SETTINGS.md)** and the **[CLI Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md)**.

### 1. Interactive TUI Mode

Just run `surge` to enter the dashboard. This is where you can visualize progress, manage the queue, and see speed graphs.

```bash
# Start the TUI
surge

# Start TUI with downloads queued
surge https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/file2.zip

# Combine URLs and batch file
surge https://example.com/file.zip --batch urls.txt
```

### 2. Server Mode (Headless)

Great for servers, Raspberry Pis, or background processes.

```bash
# Start the server
surge server

# Start the server with a download
surge server https://url.com/file.zip

# Start with explicit API token
surge server --token <token>
```

`surge` and `surge server` bind the HTTP API to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) by default.
This means the server is accessible via `localhost` (127.0.0.1) as well as your local network IP.

The API is token-protected. Generate/read your token by running:

```bash
surge token
```

### 3. Remote TUI

Connect to a running Surge daemon (local or remote).

```bash
# Connect to local server (auto-detected)
surge connect

# Connect to a remote daemon
surge connect 192.168.1.10:1700 --token <token>

# Equivalent global-flag form
surge --host 192.168.1.10:1700 --token <token>
```

By default, `surge connect` uses:

- `http://` for loopback and private IP targets
- `https://` for public/hostname targets

### 4. Global Connection Flags (CLI + TUI)

These global flags are available on all commands:

- `--host <host:port>`: target server for TUI and CLI operations.
- `--token <token>`: bearer token for authentication.

Environment variable fallbacks:

- `SURGE_HOST`
- `SURGE_TOKEN`

### 5. Server Mode with Docker Compose

Download the compose file and start the container:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SurgeDM/Surge/refs/heads/main/docker/compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Get the API token:

```bash
docker compose exec surge surge token
```

Save this token - you'll need it to authenticate API requests and connect remotely.

Check downloads/API availability:

```bash
docker compose exec surge surge ls
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f surge
```

## Fonts

Surge ships a bundled Nerd Font for the TUI, but your terminal controls the
actual font selection. See [docs/FONTS.md](docs/FONTS.md) for install steps and
licensing details.

## Benchmarks

We tested Surge against standard tools. Because of our connection optimization logic, Surge significantly outperforms single-connection tools.

| Tool            | Time             | Speed                | Comparison    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| **Surge** | **28.93s** | **35.40 MB/s** | **—**  |
| aria2c          | 40.04s           | 25.57 MB/s           | 1.38× slower |
| curl            | 57.57s           | 17.79 MB/s           | 1.99× slower |
| wget            | 61.81s           | 16.57 MB/s           | 2.14× slower |

> _Test details: 1GB file, Windows 11, Ryzen 5 5600X, 360 Mbps Network. Results averaged over 5 runs._

We would love to see you benchmark Surge on your system!
